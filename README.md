# 🏠 Boston Housing Price Prediction App

This Streamlit web application predicts the **median price of a house in Boston** using a **Linear Regression** model. Users can interactively adjust neighborhood and housing features, and the model will estimate the property value in real-time.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Data**: Boston Housing Dataset (`BostonHousing.csv`)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**  
   The app loads the Boston Housing dataset containing information such as:
   - Crime rate
   - Residential land zoning
   - Number of rooms per dwelling
   - Distance to employment centers
   - Property tax rate  
   And more...

2. **User Input (Sidebar)**  
   Users set values for 13 housing and environmental variables using sliders and dropdowns. These simulate real-world property characteristics.

3. **Model Training**  
   A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the dataset. The model learns a mathematical relationship between the input variables and house prices (`medv`).

4. **Price Prediction**  
   Based on user input, the trained model estimates the predicted median house value in dollars.

5. **Visualization**  
   The app also displays a scatter plot comparing **actual vs. predicted** prices on a test dataset, helping users understand model performance.

## 📈 Why Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a fundamental and interpretable machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It fits a straight line (or hyperplane) that best describes the relationship between input features and the target value.

### 📊 Key Benefits:
- **Simple & Fast** to train
- **Interpretability**: Coefficients show how features influence price
- **Baseline Model**: Ideal starting point before trying more complex models

It assumes that changes in features like crime rate or number of rooms cause linear changes in house price, which often holds true in real-world scenarios.
